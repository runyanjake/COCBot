Starting to see issue with mortars 1 shotting both. possibly need to think of upgrading them.
getting reliable 1-2k on each raid, with a lot of 15k+ ones in between.
mostly losses but some wins here and there. enough to keep floating in terms of trophies.
I'm not seeing many upper level THs tho so time will tell
