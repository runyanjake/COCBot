## COCBot
Revisiting an old set of game automation scripts that automate resource acquisition in a specific mobile/computer game. 2 rewrites were accomplished: A hybrid Java/AutoHotKey configuration executing compiled AHK files from the jvm, &amp; a fully AutoHotKey version with a few basic hotkey functionalities and simple UI that has been compiled into an executable.

This bot has been adjusted for a few recent game updates at the time of this repo's posting but will not be maintained going forward. Anyone forking this repo is encouraged to figure out text/image recognition to add an intelligence factor to the battle-finding ability, which will make this bot viable in most stages of the game.
